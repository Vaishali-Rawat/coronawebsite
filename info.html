                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
                    (COVID-19)
                    caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19
                    in
                    India,
                    which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020.The first cases of COVID-19 in India
                    were
                    reported in the towns of Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasargod, all in the state of Kerala, among three
                    Indian
                    medical students who had returned from Wuhan. Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in
                    the
                    rest of the country on 25 March. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all
                    reported
                    cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane. On 10 June, India's recoveries
                    exceeded
                    active cases for the first time. Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number
                    of
                    new
                    and active cases.</p>
