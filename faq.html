                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick
                    is
                    by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. If soap and water are not
                    available,
                    CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while
                    keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated
                    surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. Perform hand hygiene
                    after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your
                    hands with soap and water.</p>

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: Most studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted
                    through contact with respiratory droplets. But some recent ones have suggested that the virus may be
                    airborne, prompting updated guidelines about the use of double masking. </p>

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet. Wash them the same
                    way you should do under any circumstance: before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water.
                    Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw.</p>

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily
                    be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the
                    COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on
                    copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard. As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
                    rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>

                </summary>
                <p class="ans"> A: Yes. Data shows that when compared to never smokers, cigarette smoking increases the
                    risk
                    of more severe illness from COVID-19.Smoking cigarettes can cause inflammation and cell damage
                    throughout the body, and can weaken your immune system, making it less able to fight off disease.

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: If you are healthy and interested in donating blood, the FDA encourages you to contact
                    a
                    local donation center to make an appointment. One way to make a difference during a public health
                    emergency is to donate blood if you are able. </p>

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: Most tests to diagnose COVID-19 require a swab of your nose, or the part of the throat
                    behind the nose, by a health care provider. Some tests use saliva (spit) or other types of samples.
                    For most FDA-authorized tests, the swab or sample must be sent to a lab for analysis. Some tests
                    allow the patient to collect the sample at home and then send it to a lab for analysis. </p>

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is
                    no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the
                    skin, fur, or hair of pets.</p>

                </summary>
                <p class="ans">A: Yes. The FDA issued emergency use authorizations for three COVID-19 vaccines.
                    Additionally, the FDA is working with other vaccine developers, researchers, and manufacturers to
                    help expedite the development and availability of medical products such as additional
                    vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and other drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19.  </p>
